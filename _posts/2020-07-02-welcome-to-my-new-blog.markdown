Hello, I am Robert! I will be sharing some of my experiences with you in this blog about my journey. Follow along as I go from a pandemic forced severance of my barely survivable income of a job as Facilities Operations Manager/ DJ in NYC to a thriving Software Developer. 

Code snippets:)

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Rob')
#=> prints 'Hi, Rob' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
I am giving myself until Labor Day Weekend 2020 to learn to code. 

Can I do it? 

Do you have any tips for me? 

Do you have any advice? 

Words of encouragement? 

Are you learning now too? 

How has your journey been?

If you are looking to start coding follow my journey from the beginning or join in on the learning experience. Iâ€™m always looking for tips on how to be better follow me on Twitter and GitHub down in the descriptions. Thank you for reading!
